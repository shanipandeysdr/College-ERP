Things learned in this project

mongo db:-
1. $in = This is used to find doc with the specified info given.

2. How to perform proper calculations and proper use of loops like for-in loop and for-of loops in controllers.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------

js:-
1. .equals = This compares Things using ==.

2. .strictEquals = This compares Things using ===.

3. .trim() = this is used to remove whitespace from starting and end of the string,

4. Array.isArray is a built-in JavaScript method used to determine if a given value is an array.
 It returns true if the value is an array, and false otherwise. This method is useful for type-checking,
  ensuring that a variable is an array before performing operations that are specific to arrays, such as .
  map(), .filter(), or .reduce()

  console.log(Array.isArray([1, 2, 3])); // true
  console.log(Array.isArray("hello"));  // false
  console.log(Array.isArray({ a: 1 })); // false
  console.log(Array.isArray(null));     // false
  console.log(Array.isArray(undefined));// false

5. In JavaScript, Object.entries() is a method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable
 string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop 
 (with the exception of ordering, which is not guaranteed). This method was introduced in ECMAScript
  2017 and is very useful for iterating over objects when you need both keys and their corresponding 
  values.

6. When you call URL.createObjectURL(file), the browser generates a special type of URL called an object URL.
 This URL is linked to the file object and can be used in the src attribute of an img, video, or audio tag to
  display the file.

REACT:-
1. How to handle multiple text or input fieds using only one useState hook

2. How to handle manipluate data and send as req to backend in a useState hook in file(/admin/addCourse)

3. { ...formData, subjects }: This syntax merges the original formData with the new subjects array.
 The ...formData spreads all properties of formData into the new object, but since we provide subjects
  after ...formData, it overwrites the original subjects with the new, filtered array.

  note:- This is code snippet form axios post req in doc at "/admin/addCourse"

4. why you use data: formData with axios.delete:

    Context for Using axios.delete
    Standard Behavior: The HTTP DELETE method traditionally does not support a request body. Therefore, 
    libraries like Axios don't include a body by default when you use axios.delete.

    Modern APIs: However, modern RESTful APIs sometimes expect data to be sent with a DELETE request,
    especially when additional parameters are needed for the deletion (e.g., specifying a particular entity or resource).
